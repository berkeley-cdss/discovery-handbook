title: Using Savio
---

Research IT provides the [Savio computing cluster](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio) for use by campus researchers and their collaborators. Savio is a Linux cluster with high-speed, low-latency networking and a high-speed parallel filesystem for high performance computing (HPC).

## Request an Account

1. Visit the [MyBRC portal](https://mybrc.brc.berkeley.edu/) and log in. Most people should choose CalNet, including CalNet Sponsored Guests. External collaborators can choose **Other** and then **External Collaborator**.
1. If this is your first time creating an account, you must complete the **Sign the cluster user access agreement** task before you can join a project.
1. Click [My BRC Cluster Projects](https://mybrc.brc.berkeley.edu/project/), then [Join a project](https://mybrc.brc.berkeley.edu/project/join/).
1. Click `Search` and search for `pc_cdssdisc` in the *Project Name* field.
1. Click `Join` on the project entry.

## Sensitive Data

Those who will be working with data classified as P2 or P3 can still use Savio, but the data needs to be maintained in a [secure directory](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/getting-account/sensitive-accounts/#steps-for-sensitive-data) there. You will then need to consult with the Research Data Management (RDM) team to review the sensitivity of the data.

## Secure Research Data and Compute

The [Secure Research Data and Compute (SRDC) Platform](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/srdc/) is a secure computing environment developed for researchers working with highly sensitive P4 data. The SRDC includes high performance computing (HPC), computing on virtual machines (VMs) with Linux and Windows servers, and protected storage for both options. A combined approach of providing data management and computation support helps researchers integrate data management best practices into their larger research workflows. Through a coalition of partners from across campus, the SRDC Platform has been designed for use by a broad range of researchers, without compromising usability or performance.
